A high throughput distributed messaging system.  
Addresses shortcomings of traditional data movement tools and approaches.

Apache Kafka is a Publish/Subscribe messaging system.  

Publishers are called **producers**.    
Suscribers are called **consumers**.  

### Topic:
**Topics** is the place in Apache Kafka where all the messages will be send and read from.  

### Broker:

Broker is a software process or referred to as an executable which runs on a machine(Physical machine or Virtual machine). Broker has access to the resources on the machine such as a file system which it uses to store messages which it catrgorizes as topics
